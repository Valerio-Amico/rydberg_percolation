## Numerical simulation of the Rydberg percolation process
The rules are the following:

    . each atom can be in two states: ground and rydberg.
    . exists a probability, $p_s << 1$, that an atom get excited spontaneusly (or with a not detuned laser)
    . if one atom is excited, all atoms in the facilitation shell (defined above) can be excited faster (than with the spontaneus one).
