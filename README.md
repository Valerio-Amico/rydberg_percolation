## Numerical simulation of the Rydberg percolation process
The rules are the following:

    . each atom can be in two states: ground and rydberg.
    . exists a probability, $p_s << 1$, that an atom get excited spontaneusly, or even emits a photon with a spontaneous emission.
    . if one atom is excited, all atoms in the facilitation shell (defined above) can be excited faster (than with the spontaneus one).
    . the facilitation shell is the shell where is possible to have a "facilitated" excitations. see [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/49/15/154002/pdf].
